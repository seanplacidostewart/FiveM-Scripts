# Fivem Scripts (CitizenFX Framework)
This repository has all my Fivem server scripts that are mainly for messing about with the engine or to improve functionality of the server. I have a few more scripts that are currently in progress which I will add to this repository once they are completed and tested. These range from custom vehicle models, game modes, seemless interior warping, messing with the game engine and a few more miscellaneous scripts to improve the server in general.

# Current Scripts
| Script Name | Description |
|--|--|
| Blips | Pretty simple, small blips that will show up on either the mini map or the pause menu map. |
| Los Santos Customs | This is a script that was originally made by Mythical Bro, I have reworked it a bit to make it a bit easier for the player. Hoping to add more to this, a lot more can be done to it to make it better. |
| Notifications | This provides diffrent kind of notifications like a information box and a simple notification. There will be more notifications to come like XP award notifications like GTAO. |
| Rocket Boost | This gives any vehicles that have rockets, i.e, Scramjet, Rocket Voltic, Vigilante, etc a custom time to refill the rocket power to 100% (Yellow bar under the mini map). |
| Speed Limit | This will slow the vehicle that the player is using to a speed you set. |
| Water Strength | Change how strong/large the waves are within the water. |


# Usage

Feel free to edit or use these scripts in your server. These are just scripts that I made for my server and I am just sharing them so someone else hopfully can use them in their server.
